          What sheen of paint should I use?

            This is a great question and one that is not only dependent on how a
            room is used, but it also dependent on the how much shine the
            homeowner prefers. The higher the sheen, the more wipe-able and
            cleanable it is and the longer the paint surface will last. On the
            downside, the higher the sheen, the more the texture and wall
            anomalies will be highlighted. Colors will also ready differently
            than they will with a flat sheen. Higher sheens bounce and focus
            light. Some homeowners like that and some don’t.

          Are there any rules for choosing colors?

        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            There are a few basic rules: <br />
            <br />
            1. Take into account the existing elements in the room that already
            have a color – furniture, a wood ceiling, brick fireplace etc.{" "}
            <br />
            2. The size of the room – darker colors tend to make a room look
            smaller <br />
            3. The amount of light in a room – a lighter or brighter color can
            amplify the amount of light <br />
            4. What the room will be used for – child’s room, office, bedroom{" "}
            <br /> <br /> If you get stuck and just can’t decide, our service
            includes a 1-hr consultation with a professional Color Consultant.
            We will also apply paint in a small 2’x 2’brush out on the wall and
            on trim.

            On interior projects, bubbling and peeling are not a typical problem
            in most areas where moisture and heat are not present. Homeowners
            with pets and children will notice more nicks, dents and dirt
            faster. We recommend paint with a higher sheen in these cases,
            especially in the hallway or children’s bedroom, so that most of
            these things can be wiped down. We provide a 5-yr guarantee against,
            peeling, bubbling and cracking of the paint film.

          How much will it cost?

        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            Cost is dependent on what the scope of work is, what the surface
            conditions are, what the desired color scheme is and how much
            materials will be needed. The best way to understand cost is to
            schedule a consultation where we get a complete understanding of
            what your goals are and what will be required to complete the
            project.{" "}

          My walls are cracking and sagging – why? What can be done?

          <p>
            Walls are constructed of either lath and plaster or sheet-rock. Lath
            and plaster is an older building material and can typically be found
            in homes constructed pre-World War II. Plaster is applied over a
            wire lath or a thin layer of paper and it has the propensity to
            crack and fail. Sagging can be caused by the paper underneath. When
            painted, that paper can be activated and will bubble and move,
            resulting in sagging. Sheetrock, on the other hand, rarely cracks
            unless put under seismic pressure or some other extreme
            circumstance. The tape that bridges the seams of the sheets is more
            likely to fail (in an Earthquake for example), but happens more
            rarely.
